#Script for pulling most recent images of certain keywords from Lightroom 6 Catalog
##Things still to do:
- Make sure GeekTool can delete the original files that have been copied in, or else change their file names right away and don't duplicate.  Well, just make sure it can delete them.  Give whatever the user is for geektool permissions.
- Do a for loop with the keywords set at the beginning to have an unlimited number of keywords possible.
- Condense the repetitive code in the sqlite queries.
